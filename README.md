# 🌐 AI Tools Hub  

Hi there 👋,  
I’m **Sakshi**, a student and beginner in web development.  
This is a small project I built while practicing **HTML & CSS** — a simple website about **AI and different tools**.  

I wanted to explore how a real website looks with a **navigation bar, responsive layout, transitions and clean UI**.  
So I created **AI Tools Hub** — a practice project for learning and fun. 💡

It helped me understand:  
- How to design a **navigation bar**  
- How to make layouts look good on **desktop & mobile**  
- How to add **hover effects and transitions**
